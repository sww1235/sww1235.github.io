<p>After having used both Revit and Vectorworks, these are my first impressions of both softwares</p>
<p>Revit is much less user friendly, more complex but much more powerful. It has a small standard library of doors and windows, hardware, etc, but if you want to introduce anything custom, there is a larger amount of work involved as Revit lacks the powerful door and window tools of Vectorworks by default. There are Revit plugins you can buy to duplicate this functionality, or you can spend a disproportionate amount of time designing custom families if you need custom products.</p>
<p>This is somewhat offset by the fact that some manufacturers offer Revit families of their products, however these often lack flexibility and are somewhat confusing to use, especially for larger families such as elevators.</p>
<p>Vectorworks has much better tools for creating custom generic objects such as doors, windows and elevators which allow for more creative flexibility as you are not restricted to manufacter provided sizes.</p>
<p>Revit has a much better MEP toolset then Vectorworks as well as integrates the structural model of the building much better. Their structural members tool actually <strong>works</strong> and can be used to do structural analysis of the building.</p>
<p>Revit has a much larger userbase and is supported by Autodesk's large community forumns.</p>
<p>Revit is very easy to use if you stick to the defaults. I was able to create a fairly complex architectural model of a building in about 16 hours of off and on work and learning. however it took me a similar amount of time to create a custom door and a similar amount of time to create a custom bookshelf.</p>
<p>This was similar to Vectorworks, however the Vectorworks plugin objects like doors and windows are much more flexible by default than revits so I did not need to create custom versions of those.</p>
